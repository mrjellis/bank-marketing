### Data source for this project 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing


### Notes

1. The dataset used in the analysis is queried from a postgresql database. 
The data are not big enough to require this, however it was good practice. 
Alternatively, source data can be found in the `/Data`folder

2. Directions on the appropriate order to run the files are present in the `/Directions` folder text file.
